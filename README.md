# odin-landing-page

This is the second project given by The Odin Project, finally get to do some JavaScript.

I thought my idea was pretty good but the color scheme could've been better. As i used an AI generated logo i used the colors provided in the logo and went with that.

Hopefully there will be some better projects on my GitHub soon.
